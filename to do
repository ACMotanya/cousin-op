Please follow these steps:

Insert a non-accepted SIM card (from a network provider other than AT&T) and turn on the phone. If the card has a PIN, press "Unlock" and type PIN.

You will see that your iPhone has no service.

Open iTunes on your computer and connect your iPhone via USB cable.

iTunes will connect to the Apple server, check the unlock service requested and automatically apply it to your phone.

Disconnect and restart your iPhone. Your iPhone is now successfully unlocked! (To turn off phone you must hold down the top button until "Turn off" displays on the phoneÂ´s screen).
