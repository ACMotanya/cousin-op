			<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-plus"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-remove"></i>Is ordering online secure?</div>
			<div class="togglec">Yes, we take the utmost care with the information that you provide us with when placing an order on our website (or through any other means).<br><br>
				<ul class="leftmargin">
					<li>The server that hosts our store encrypts the transmission of all credit card and personal customer information using the Internet-standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol.</li>
					<li>During the encryption process, information is scrambled into small bits of code that cannot be read as it travels to us over the Internet.</li>
					<li>Once we receive the encrypted information, we use a private, key to decode it.</li>
					<li>All information that you provide during the ordering process is restricted to our staff, and we make sure that all of our employees are up-to-date on our security and privacy policies.</li>
				</ul>

				If you have further questions about the security of ordering online from Laura Janelle, do not hesitate to e-mail us at info@laurajanelle.com or by phone Monday-Friday between the hours of 9am-5pm EST at (844)366-6900
